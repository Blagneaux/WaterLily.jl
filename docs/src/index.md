<!--- This generates just a collection of all documentation you have written.
Therefore it collects all docstrings and pushes them into a html file.
Not super nice but a starting for the documentation.
For this to work I think you need github pages, which you can enable in the github options of the project. --->

```@autodocs
Modules = [WaterLily]
```

```@index
```
